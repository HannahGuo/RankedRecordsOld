# Ranked Records

Ranked Records is my personal project that ranks all tracks from Spotify artists by popularity. I made this application because I wanted to see more than the default 5 top tracks that Spotify displays. 

This project is built off of [Spotify's Client Credentials Flow Example](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples). 

It's also my first time using Node.js
