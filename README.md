# Ranked Records (Old)

I wanted to post this project because it was my first attempt at [Ranked Records](https://github.com/HannahGuo/RankedRecords). I really had no idea what I was doing. This code should not be used as a reference - it's just a fun memory.

I'm happy to say I have a better idea now :)

Please see the current [Ranked Records](https://github.com/HannahGuo/RankedRecords) repository.

## Original README content.

Ranked Records is my personal project that ranks all tracks from Spotify artists by popularity. I made this application because I wanted to see more than the default 5 top tracks that Spotify displays. 

This project is built off of [Spotify's Client Credentials Flow Example](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples). 

It's also my first time using Node.js
